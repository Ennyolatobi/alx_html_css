# ALX HTML & CSS Project – CSS Basic

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering Program and focuses on introducing **basic CSS styling**, **layout positioning**, and **responsive design**.  

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to enhance the HTML pages created in the `html_basic` project by adding styling and layout control using CSS. This includes:
- Applying base styles with `base.css` and `styles.css`
- Using **Flexbox** to position `header`, `main`, `article`, `aside`, and `footer`
- Ensuring responsive design for smartphone and smaller screens
- Adding additional custom styling to make the site unique

## 🛠️ Files in This Project
- **index.html** – Main homepage with links and layout structure  
- **tweets.html** – Page displaying tweets and related content  
- **base.css** – Predefined base styles (provided by ALX)  
- **styles.css** – Custom styles for layout and personalization  

## 📑 Requirements
- All files must end with a newline  
- A `README.md` is mandatory at the root of the project folder  
- No external libraries (Bootstrap, React, etc.) are allowed  
- Code must be **W3C compliant** and validate with [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)  

## 📱 Responsive Design
The `<body>` tag uses the `works_on_smartphone` class, and a viewport meta tag is included to ensure the site adjusts nicely on mobile devices.  

## 🚀 Deployment
This project can be deployed using GitHub Pages. Ensure that `index.html` is in the correct directory selected for deployment in GitHub Pages settings.
